    <h1>Servlet Intro Quiz</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        What is the difference between a web server and a web container?
        <p>
          Web server refers to an execution infrastructure that handles HTTP
          requests and responses. a servlet container refers to a component that
          handles the lifecycle for servlets. an application server refers to a
          framework (servlet container, EJB container, JSP engine, MQ container,
          etc.) for handling Web applications. However, a Web container has a
          couple of meanings depending on the source. Most refer to a Web
          container as the part of an application server that manages servlets,
          JavaServer Pages (JSP) files, and other Web-tier components. Web
          container is the infrastructure for managing the lifecycle for Web
          services.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        What is a servlet?
        <p>
          Servlet is a class that handles requests,processes them and reply back
          with response .for example we can use servlet to collect input from
          the user through an HTML form,query the records from database and
          create web page dynamically.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        How do web servers and web containers interact with servlets?
        <p>
          When the client sends a request, the server handles the request to the
          web container and the web container is the one that needs to search in
          the list of its servlets if there is one that its url-pattern
          corresponds to the url request. If it finds one, it leaves to this
          servlet the responsibility of process the request, if it doesn't find
          anyone it throws a 404 error.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Who creates request objects?
        <p>
          Servlet container creates the request and response for servlet.
        </p>
      </li>

        What are the states in the servlet lifecycle?

        />
        <p>
          1 - Load 2 - Create 3 - Init 4 - Service 5 - Destroy
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        Who calls init and when?
        <p>
          Servlet container after instantiating the servlet once in the
          servletâ€™s lifecycle.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Which of init, service, and doGet should you override?
        <p>
          Service method should not be overridden otherwise developer is
          responsible for consequences but init and doGet should be overridden.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        In what sense are servlets multi-threaded?
        <p>
          multiple requests to the same servlet may be executed at the same
          time. An object instance('s methods) can be called simultaneously by
          more than one thread. This isn't specific for servlets though and is
          true in general.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        What are the implications of this for servlet instance variables?
        <p>
          The container does not create a new instance of the Servlet class for
          each request. It reuses an existing one. This is why they are not
          thread safe.
