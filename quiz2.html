      <li>
        Can post requests be bookmarked? What are the problems?
        <p>
          An HTTP POST can be bookmarked, but since a bookmark only consists of
          the URL, all of the form parameters will be lost. This will often mean
          that the web server doesn't know what to do with the request, since it
          was expecting some form parameters. A POST cannot be bookmarked
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        What is the purpose of request dispatching?
        <p>
          Request Dispatcher enables to dispatch the request to another
          resources like HTML, JSP, or Servlet.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        What is the difference between redirect and request dispatch?
        <p>
          Redirect is sent to the client as a response while the request
          dispatch is performed completely in the server and the result of the
          forward from the request dispatch is returned as a response to the
          client.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        What is an attribute ?
        <p>
          An attribute is a variable that you can save in one of the scope of an
          application. When I say scope, I mean Page, Request, Session,
          Application. To save the attribute you call the setAttribute() method
          and to retrieve you call the getAttribute() method
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        What is the difference between attributes and parameters?

        <p>
          parameters are read only, attributes are read/write objects.
          Parameters are String objects, attributes can be objects of any type.
        </p>
      </li>

      <li>
        What are dangers of using attributes?
        <p>
          Use this method when the form has no side-effects and contains only
          ASCII characters.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        What does it mean to say that http is stateless? Give an example of a
        stateful protocol.
        <p>
          HTTP protocol does not keep track, or does not have knowledge of the
          previous requests. An example of a stateful protocol is TCP, in which
          it keeps track of the packets received in order to be reassemble them
          at the destination.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Give 5 different methods for maintaining state information (count each
        attribute scope as one method).
        <p>
          1. request scope 2. session scope 3. application scope 4. cookies 5.
          hidden fields
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        How long does a session last?
        <p>
          destroyed when user closes browser.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        What is a cookie, and how long does a cookie last?
        <p>
          The duration of a cookie can be set when it is created. By default,
          the cookie is destroyed when the current browser window is closed.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        What is the purpose of URL rewriting?
        <p>
          URL rewriting is an alternative way of passing the data if the user
          disables the cookies and also extra form submission is not required on
          each page.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Why does the request attribute report ‘null’ for the maintaining state
        demo?
        <p>
          If the request is completed the request attribute report ‘null’ for
          the maintaining state demo
        </p>
